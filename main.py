# ---- Loops, Conditionals, and Strings! ----

word = 'bag'

# 1. Set up a loop to iterate through the string of lowercase vowels, 'aeiou'.



# 2 & 3. Inside the loop, create and print a new string from 'word', but with a different vowel. Use the replace() method.





# 4. After you have your code working, try other words besides 'bag'.
